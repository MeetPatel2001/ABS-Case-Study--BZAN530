       "      <td>On May 17, 2014, while in the process of performing abandonment operations on Walter Oil and Gas's (Walter) #001 well, three employees onboard the Rowan Gorilla IV were burned by a flash fire when welding operations ignited gas that had migrated into the wellbore. The rig crew had just finished cutting and pulling the 22 inch casing from the well and was preparing to move on to the 36 inch casing. A 'Hot Work Permit', along with a Job Safety Analysis (JSA), was filled out by the crew members before operations began. Although the documents were filled out as required, both failed to identify all of the hazards associated with the operation. Furthermore, Walter's approved welding plan calls for strict supervision of welding operations that take place outside of the 'Safe Welding Area'. More oversight on the part of the Supervisors may have helped prevent the accident. In order to complete the task, the crew was going to need to weld pad eyes to the inside of the casing in order to latch onto the load and pull it from the well. The preferred way to accomplish this task would have been to weld the pad eyes to the outside of the casing. Because of the casing's large diameter (36 inches), the pad eyes needed to be welded to the inside walls to allow enough room for the casing to pass through the rotary on the drill floor. The JSA completed prior to the start of the job failed to identify any hazards associated with performing welding operations in a hazardous area or the risk of gas being ignited from inside the well. During the investigation, a Permit to Work was provided to the inspectors upon request but the form was incomplete. There are specific sections on the form that are provided to allow for the gas readings to be recorded and the certification dates of the equipment to be documented, but all were blank. In addition, several of the precautions stated in Walter's approved \"Welding, Burning, and Hot-Tapping Plan\" were ignored or overlooked, increasing the chances of an accident. The crew cut the 36 inch casing and began getting ready to remove it. As the pad eyes were being welded to the inside of the pipe, burning slag was allowed to fall inside of the wellbore. The gas that was present inside the well was ignited, which caused flames to be shot out of the casing at the surface. Three employees near the casing at the time of the incident suffered first and second degree burns to their upper bodies. The job was stopped and all three of the injured employees were sent to the hospital for further evaluation. The investigation following the accident showed that the gas readings near the surface, where the injured employees were burned, had no gas present. A gas detector was then sent down the inside of the casing, and at a depth of approximately 40 feet, the gas readings increased significantly. It was determined that the gas had entered the wellbore after the casing was cut, which allowed the gas to migrate from the reservoir into the well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On 7 July 2014, at approximately 1940 hours an incident occurred that resulted in injuries to two Seadrill employees. The first injured employee (IE1) was sent to the hospital with lacerations to his elbow and bruising on the left side of his body. The second injured employee (IE2) was sent to the hospital with 2 fractured ribs and a lacerated spleen. For Public Release While performing workover operations, the drill crew had to pull the production tubing from the wellbore. The drill crew tripped in the well a tubing hanger mechanical recovery tool (THMRT). Once the THMRT was latched in the tubing hanger the drill crew started pulling the tubing out of the well. With the tubing hanger at the rotary table the THMRT had to be removed and a tubing hanger handling tool (THHT) installed. The FMC Technologies' procedures document shows that the onsite FMC Technologies Representative initialed each procedural step for the installation of the THHT in the tubing hanger. At the time of the investigation it is unknown whether the THHT failed due to a mechanical failure or whether the THHT was not installed properly. The entire assembly was passed from the main rotary to the auxiliary rotary so it could be transported to the main deck storage area. Using an air tugger, the drill crew landed the hanger on the pipe skate and began to tail the assembly out from the drill floor. When the assembly reached approximately a 35° angle the THHT separated from the tubing hanger. The hanger fell approximately 15' to the pipe skate and bounced from side to side on the skate. The tugger operator (IE2) was struck by the tubing hanger and another employee (IE1) on the opposite side of the skate fell to the deck to avoid the tubing hanger. At the time of the investigation it was unclear whether IE1 was struck by the tubing hanger or was injured as he fell. Both employees were sent to the hospital via medevac.</td>\n",

       "1  On May 17, 2014, while in the process of performing abandonment operations on Walter Oil and Gas's (Walter) #001 well, three employees onboard the Rowan Gorilla IV were burned by a flash fire when welding operations ignited gas that had migrated into the wellbore. The rig crew had just finished cutting and pulling the 22 inch casing from the well and was preparing to move on to the 36 inch casing. A 'Hot Work Permit', along with a Job Safety Analysis (JSA), was filled out by the crew members before operations began. Although the documents were filled out as required, both failed to identify all of the hazards associated with the operation. Furthermore, Walter's approved welding plan calls for strict supervision of welding operations that take place outside of the 'Safe Welding Area'. More oversight on the part of the Supervisors may have helped prevent the accident. In order to complete the task, the crew was going to need to weld pad eyes to the inside of the casing in order to latch onto the load and pull it from the well. The preferred way to accomplish this task would have been to weld the pad eyes to the outside of the casing. Because of the casing's large diameter (36 inches), the pad eyes needed to be welded to the inside walls to allow enough room for the casing to pass through the rotary on the drill floor. The JSA completed prior to the start of the job failed to identify any hazards associated with performing welding operations in a hazardous area or the risk of gas being ignited from inside the well. During the investigation, a Permit to Work was provided to the inspectors upon request but the form was incomplete. There are specific sections on the form that are provided to allow for the gas readings to be recorded and the certification dates of the equipment to be documented, but all were blank. In addition, several of the precautions stated in Walter's approved \"Welding, Burning, and Hot-Tapping Plan\" were ignored or overlooked, increasing the chances of an accident. The crew cut the 36 inch casing and began getting ready to remove it. As the pad eyes were being welded to the inside of the pipe, burning slag was allowed to fall inside of the wellbore. The gas that was present inside the well was ignited, which caused flames to be shot out of the casing at the surface. Three employees near the casing at the time of the incident suffered first and second degree burns to their upper bodies. The job was stopped and all three of the injured employees were sent to the hospital for further evaluation. The investigation following the accident showed that the gas readings near the surface, where the injured employees were burned, had no gas present. A gas detector was then sent down the inside of the casing, and at a depth of approximately 40 feet, the gas readings increased significantly. It was determined that the gas had entered the wellbore after the casing was cut, which allowed the gas to migrate from the reservoir into the well.   \n",

The first injured employee (IE1) was sent to the hospital with lacerations to his elbow and bruising on the left side of his body. The second injured employee (IE2) was sent to the hospital with 2 fractured ribs and a lacerated spleen. For Public Release While performing workover operations, the drill crew had to pull the production tubing from the wellbore. The drill crew tripped in the well a tubing hanger mechanical recovery tool (THMRT). Once the THMRT was latched in the tubing hanger the drill crew started pulling the tubing out of the well. With the tubing hanger at the rotary table the THMRT had to be removed and a tubing hanger handling tool (THHT) installed. The FMC Technologies' procedures document shows that the onsite FMC Technologies Representative initialed each procedural step for the installation of the THHT in the tubing hanger. At the time of the investigation it is unknown whether the THHT failed due to a mechanical failure or whether the THHT was not installed properly. The entire assembly was passed from the main rotary to the auxiliary rotary so it could be transported to the main deck storage area. Using an air tugger, the drill crew landed the hanger on the pipe skate and began to tail the assembly out from the drill floor. When the assembly reached approximately a 35° angle the THHT separated from the tubing hanger. The hanger fell approximately 15' to the pipe skate and bounced from side to side on the skate. The tugger operator (IE2) was struck by the tubing hanger and another employee (IE1) on the opposite side of the skate fell to the deck to avoid the tubing hanger. At the time of the investigation it was unclear whether IE1 was struck by the tubing hanger or was injured as he fell. Both employees were sent to the hospital via medevac.   \n",

       "      <td>At approximately 17:00 hours on 1 October 2014, the offshore supply vessel (OSV)\\nEndurance lost station keeping while conducting well operations for Fieldwood Energy\\nLLC (Fieldwood) on Well A002 located at the Eugene Island (EI) Block 355A platform.\\nThe Endurance is a dynamically-positioning (DP) capable OSV equipped with a DP-1\\nsystem and is owned and operated by Freedom Marine Services (FMS) of Houma,\\nLouisiana. The FMS Endurance had a cement pump staged on board that was connected to\\nthe Well A002 production tree with rigid high pressure lines and had pressure tested\\nthe wireline lubricator to 4000 pounds per square inch. When the crew was running in\\nthe hole with wireline and was at a depth of 9000 feet (ft), for reasons unknown, the\\nFMS Endurance lost its station keeping and started moving away from the EI-355A\\nplatform. As the vessel moved off location, the Well A002 production tree was severed\\nat the wellhead flange and fell overboard but was later retrieved. The well was\\nsecured by closing the downhole safety valve and by installing a temporary flange cap\\non the tubing head. The lubricator on top of the production tree and connected to\\nthe wireline unit staged on the platform, fell over onto the platform deck damaging\\nsome hand railing and grating in the vicinity of Well A002. An estimated area of 300\\nft by 50 ft of oil was spilled into the offshore waters which was reported to the\\nUnited States Coast Guard (USCG) National Response Center (NRC), NRC Report #\\n1097096. There were no reported injuries associated with this incident. On 6\\nOctober 2014, Well A002 was secured by installing a new production tree for future\\nremedial work.\\nIn a written statement to the USCG, the captain of the FMS Endurance stated that the\\nbow thruster alarm had sounded several times on 1 October 2014, but each time it was\\nable to reset into the DP mode without losing station keeping. However, at 16:34\\nhours, the bow thruster alarm sounded again and although power was not loss, the DP\\nsystem was failing to maintain the vessel's position. As a consequence, the captain\\ntook over manual controls and put both throttles full astern, but the vessel\\ncontinued to move forward due to its initial momentum causing the rigid high pressure\\nline to shear the Well A002 production tree off the wellhead.\\nDuring October of 2014, FMS and USCG along with International Marine Systems, Marine\\nTechnologies, Fugro, and Rhodes Electronics completed a series of diagnostic checks\\nof the entire DP systems. FMS was directed by the USCG to try to recreate the\\ncircumstances that occurred on 1 October 2014 as recorded on the FMS Endurance's\\nevent log. Several days of sea trials were conducted; however, and no issues were\\nfound with the DP system. However, during the analysis of the FMS Endurance's event\\nlog, it revealed that the DP system, gyro and throttles all went out at once due to\\nsome type of electrical interference.\\nThe FMS Endurance had a communication tower recently installed and according to the\\ncommunication tower vendor, it should not have been placed near any vital GPS\\nequipment. On the day of the incident, the communications tower was located 6 inches\\n(in) from the throttle system boards, 28 in from the gyro system and the DP system\\nwas approximately 1 ft below the communication tower. Based upon this information,\\nall parties believed that since the communications tower was located within 1 ft of\\nthe DP system, it may have caused electronic interferences as it received or\\ntransmitted signals on the day of the incident.\\nFMS has since implemented a policy for all of their DP vessels that no communications\\nequipment can be located within 1 meter (3.28 ft) of the throttle control computer,\\nDP computer or gyros. In addition, a safety break-away hose coupling will be\\nutilized in future applications.\\nOn 24 February 2015, the USCG and BSEE issued a joint Safety Alert that addressed DP\\nsystem failures on OSVs that are engaged in oil and gas operations in the U.S. outer\\ncontinental shelf.\\nMMS - FORM 2010 PAGE: 2 OF 4\\n­\\nEV2010R 08-APR-2015\\n­\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Public Release\\nThe FMS Incident Investigation Report submitted to BSEE by Fieldwood indicated that\\nthe probable cause of the FMS Endurance losing station keeping and stripping off the\\nWell A002 production tree was attributed to some type of electrical interference with\\nthe DP system from a communications tower that was installed on the vessel near the\\nGPS equipment.\\nThe possible contributing cause can be attributed to the absence of an emergency\\ndisconnect coupling within the rigid hard line piping from the FMS Endurance and Well\\nA002 that would allow a quick disconnect of the piping in the event of a loss of\\nstation keeping by the vessel.</td>\n",

Recommended replacing cables to eliminate splices in safety system cables and possibilities of nuisance trips due to bad connections in the future. Would require approximately 200' of each cable to replace. Also re-routed cables to opposite side of stairs to prevent them from getting cut again in the future.</td>\n",

       "0  At approximately 17:00 hours on 1 October 2014, the offshore supply vessel (OSV)\\nEndurance lost station keeping while conducting well operations for Fieldwood Energy\\nLLC (Fieldwood) on Well A002 located at the Eugene Island (EI) Block 355A platform.\\nThe Endurance is a dynamically-positioning (DP) capable OSV equipped with a DP-1\\nsystem and is owned and operated by Freedom Marine Services (FMS) of Houma,\\nLouisiana. The FMS Endurance had a cement pump staged on board that was connected to\\nthe Well A002 production tree with rigid high pressure lines and had pressure tested\\nthe wireline lubricator to 4000 pounds per square inch. When the crew was running in\\nthe hole with wireline and was at a depth of 9000 feet (ft), for reasons unknown, the\\nFMS Endurance lost its station keeping and started moving away from the EI-355A\\nplatform. As the vessel moved off location, the Well A002 production tree was severed\\nat the wellhead flange and fell overboard but was later retrieved. The well was\\nsecured by closing the downhole safety valve and by installing a temporary flange cap\\non the tubing head. The lubricator on top of the production tree and connected to\\nthe wireline unit staged on the platform, fell over onto the platform deck damaging\\nsome hand railing and grating in the vicinity of Well A002. An estimated area of 300\\nft by 50 ft of oil was spilled into the offshore waters which was reported to the\\nUnited States Coast Guard (USCG) National Response Center (NRC), NRC Report #\\n1097096. There were no reported injuries associated with this incident. On 6\\nOctober 2014, Well A002 was secured by installing a new production tree for future\\nremedial work.\\nIn a written statement to the USCG, the captain of the FMS Endurance stated that the\\nbow thruster alarm had sounded several times on 1 October 2014, but each time it was\\nable to reset into the DP mode without losing station keeping. However, at 16:34\\nhours, the bow thruster alarm sounded again and although power was not loss, the DP\\nsystem was failing to maintain the vessel's position. As a consequence, the captain\\ntook over manual controls and put both throttles full astern, but the vessel\\ncontinued to move forward due to its initial momentum causing the rigid high pressure\\nline to shear the Well A002 production tree off the wellhead.\\nDuring October of 2014, FMS and USCG along with International Marine Systems, Marine\\nTechnologies, Fugro, and Rhodes Electronics completed a series of diagnostic checks\\nof the entire DP systems. FMS was directed by the USCG to try to recreate the\\ncircumstances that occurred on 1 October 2014 as recorded on the FMS Endurance's\\nevent log. Several days of sea trials were conducted; however, and no issues were\\nfound with the DP system. However, during the analysis of the FMS Endurance's event\\nlog, it revealed that the DP system, gyro and throttles all went out at once due to\\nsome type of electrical interference.\\nThe FMS Endurance had a communication tower recently installed and according to the\\ncommunication tower vendor, it should not have been placed near any vital GPS\\nequipment. On the day of the incident, the communications tower was located 6 inches\\n(in) from the throttle system boards, 28 in from the gyro system and the DP system\\nwas approximately 1 ft below the communication tower. Based upon this information,\\nall parties believed that since the communications tower was located within 1 ft of\\nthe DP system, it may have caused electronic interferences as it received or\\ntransmitted signals on the day of the incident.\\nFMS has since implemented a policy for all of their DP vessels that no communications\\nequipment can be located within 1 meter (3.28 ft) of the throttle control computer,\\nDP computer or gyros. In addition, a safety break-away hose coupling will be\\nutilized in future applications.\\nOn 24 February 2015, the USCG and BSEE issued a joint Safety Alert that addressed DP\\nsystem failures on OSVs that are engaged in oil and gas operations in the U.S. outer\\ncontinental shelf.\\nMMS - FORM 2010 PAGE: 2 OF 4\\n­\\nEV2010R 08-APR-2015\\n­\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Public Release\\nThe FMS Incident Investigation Report submitted to BSEE by Fieldwood indicated that\\nthe probable cause of the FMS Endurance losing station keeping and stripping off the\\nWell A002 production tree was attributed to some type of electrical interference with\\nthe DP system from a communications tower that was installed on the vessel near the\\nGPS equipment.\\nThe possible contributing cause can be attributed to the absence of an emergency\\ndisconnect coupling within the rigid hard line piping from the FMS Endurance and Well\\nA002 that would allow a quick disconnect of the piping in the event of a loss of\\nstation keeping by the vessel.    \n",

Cabling shorted and tripped platform TSE / Deluge system. _x000D__x000D_\\nCorrective Action:  Spliced cabling and put in junction boxes and reset breaker for deluge and everything is back to normal and out of by-pass. Recommended replacing cables to eliminate splices in safety system cables and possibilities of nuisance trips due to bad connections in the future. Would require approximately 200' of each cable to replace. Also re-routed cables to opposite side of stairs to prevent them from getting cut again in the future.   \n",

While attempting to roll pipe to properly position it, the IP's finger was smashed between the flange and another pipe. _x000D_\\nAfter preliminary evaluation by the field medic, the IP was evacuated by boat for further medical treatment. The IP was diagnosed with a fracture to the tip of his left index finger. _x000D_\\nThe IP required amputation of the to the first knuckle and was given a release to return to work without restrictions. _x000D__x000D_\\nCorrective Actions required of contractor by FWE include; ACI implemented Time Out SWA program, ACI continuing quarterly company-wide safety meetings and this incident was made the focus of all recent crew specific safety meetings.   \n",

The slag/spark fell through the solid deck to the production equipment located on the lower deck. The Flotation Cell hatches had a small amount of gas leaking through their gaskets. The slag/spark ignited the gas. The resulting flame melted a TSE and initiated a complete facility shut-in. Operations personnel were able to quickly identify the fire and extinguished it with a local fire hose and portable fire extinguisher. There were no injuries or pollution._x000D_\\nCORRECTIVE ACTIONS: The following day the gaskets on the hatches of the WEMCO (handles produced water) were replaced. The deluge system, which didn't function at 100% capacity, was tested. The nozzles are being replaced and an I&E technician was testing the signal to the system to verify whether is was operating as designed.    \n",

The driller opened the 9-5/8\" UPR to pick up on test joint in the well.  The test joint was lifted 30' and the Blind Shear Rams were closed.  At 16:32 hours the OIM of the Ensco 8505 activated the Emergency Muster alarm.  A DP double was removed and a TIW installed. At 16:50 hours the well became static and the muster alarm was canceled. The DP, choke & kill lines and riser were all circulated out with 9.7ppg brine. The drill crew then performed a bull head operation (down kill line and crossed over to the production tubing via the tree XO line) with 9.7 PPG brine into the well at an initial rate of 5 BPM at 250 PSI.  A total of 210 BBLS of 9.7 PPG and 190 BBLS of 11.6 PPG brine was bullheaded down tubing into well.  The well pressure decreased to \"0\" PSI and the tree XO line valves were closed.   \n",

The flash fire occurred on Well B-1 (API #427034012000) at the\\nplus ten deck when Tetra Offshore welding personnel were cutting slots in the B-1\\nconductor for the installation of lifting plates.\\nAn initial combustible gas check was completed prior to commencing cutting\\noperations. A Hot Work Permit for Tetra Offshore, a Hot Work Permit for Fieldwood\\nEnergy, and a completed Job Safety Analysis (JSA) were provided to BSEE\\ninvestigators. According to the Hot Work Permits, the operator’s final report and\\nwitness statements, an Altair 5x gas detector was utilized at the cellar deck level,\\nresulting in a gas detection of 0% Lower Explosive Limit (LEL). The Altair 5x Gas\\nDetector was bump tested by the onsite safety representative prior to use. Following\\nthe negative gas detection check, explosives were detonated in order to sever the\\nconductor below the mud line. This caused the conductor to drop four to five feet\\nbelow the cellar deck, which required the lifting plates be installed at the plus ten\\ndeck instead of just below the wellhead, where the initial gas check was completed.\\nFollowing detonation, a combustible gas detection check was conducted in the\\ninnermost casing near the casing valve flanges (just below the well head), resulting\\nin 0% LEL. After successfully cutting through the 42 inch drive pipe and the 20 inch\\ncasing, the welder began cutting the slot on the 13 3/8 inch casing. At\\napproximately 8:25 pm, a Tetra Offshore welder cut through the 13 3/8 inch casing at\\nthe plus ten deck with an Oxylance burning bar, igniting flammable gas trapped inside\\nthe 13 3/8 inch x 9 5/8 inch casing annulus. Operator statements report personnel\\nunsuccessfully attempted to extinguish the fire with a small water hose, and decided\\nto radio all personnel to evacuate the platform to the supporting derrick barge\\n(Tetra Hedron). According to personnel evacuating the platform, the flash fire\\nburned for an estimated 30 seconds and then extinguished itself. Fieldwood Energy\\nreported no injuries, pollution, or property damage.\\nAfter mustering the crew, the onsite supervisor assessed the situation and began\\nmitigation. The B-1 well casing valves were again tested for the presence of a\\ncombustible gas at the wellhead. The slot cut on the plus ten deck where the flash\\nfire occurred was also tested, but the small penetration of the 13 3/8 inch casing\\ndid not allow the gas detector to sense inside of the annulus. A 3/8 inch pilot hole\\nwas drilled at the plus ten deck through the 13 3/8 inch, 9 5/8 inch, and 7 3/4 inch\\nwall casings, and a combustible gas test was conducted. After drilling the pilot\\nhole, the measured LEL was too high for the gas detector to properly read.\\nCompressed air was supplied to 7 3/4 inch casing and circulated through the 9 5/8\\ninch and 13 3/8 inch casings, and then vented through the 3/8 inch pilot hole.\\nAnother combustible gas test was conducted, and the LEL ranged between 5% LEL to 16%\\nLEL in 20 minutes. The 3/8 inch pilot hole was then sealed, and compressed air was\\nsupplied into the 13 3/8 casing flange and circulated through the 13 3/8 inch x 9 5/8\\ninch annulus. A final combustible gas test was conducted and found to have 0% LEL.\\nAt 3:05 am, the site was deemed safe, an Ultimate Work Authority document to resume\\noperations (provided to BSEE investigators) was completed, and operations continued. \\n\\n</td>\n",

The dump valve on the slug pit was open and waste pit #6 had stagnant fluid. Once drill water from slug pit #1 started to fill up waste pit #6, the gas vapors went up through the dump valve on slug pit #1 and reached the Active Mud Pit Room sensors. Fixed alarm detector was triggered with an H2S reading of 11 ppm._x000D_\\n_x000D_\\nAt 03:36 hours the H2S automated alarm system sounded. At 03:39 all personnel were instructed to muster on heli-deck. Well was confirmed secured (current operations were TIH with BSR #1 closed).  At 03:52 full muster was accomplished.

Personnel stopped the operation and switched the hydra-racker in manual mode to attempt to restore the hydra-racker to vertical. The pre-programmed deviation alarm shutdown was then activated, reading 0.5 meters misalignment on the cyber-chair screen; actual measurement was ~15' of misalignment. Initial inspections found damage to the upper drive trolley._x000D_\\n _x000D_\\nRoot Cause Analysis:  By extracting the raw data from each the lower and upper encoder, it was found that the PLC was receiving erratic data from the lower trolley encoder, which resulted in the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) sending erroneous signals to the lower drive trolley.  This malfunction caused the lower drive trolley to drive ahead of the upper drive trolley.  The NOV representative repaired the upper drive trolley and replaced the faulty encoder.  NOV then declared the unit fit for service._x000D_   \n",

       "4  On October 2, 2015, a flash fire occurred during decommissioning activities on\\nMatagorda Island 685, Platform “A,” OCS-G-04548, operated by GOM Shelf, LLC.\\nFieldwood Energy has assumed decommissioning liability for this platform and\\nassociated wells. The flash fire occurred on Well B-1 (API #427034012000) at the\\nplus ten deck when Tetra Offshore welding personnel were cutting slots in the B-1\\nconductor for the installation of lifting plates.\\nAn initial combustible gas check was completed prior to commencing cutting\\noperations. A Hot Work Permit for Tetra Offshore, a Hot Work Permit for Fieldwood\\nEnergy, and a completed Job Safety Analysis (JSA) were provided to BSEE\\ninvestigators. According to the Hot Work Permits, the operator’s final report and\\nwitness statements, an Altair 5x gas detector was utilized at the cellar deck level,\\nresulting in a gas detection of 0% Lower Explosive Limit (LEL). The Altair 5x Gas\\nDetector was bump tested by the onsite safety representative prior to use. Following\\nthe negative gas detection check, explosives were detonated in order to sever the\\nconductor below the mud line. This caused the conductor to drop four to five feet\\nbelow the cellar deck, which required the lifting plates be installed at the plus ten\\ndeck instead of just below the wellhead, where the initial gas check was completed.\\nFollowing detonation, a combustible gas detection check was conducted in the\\ninnermost casing near the casing valve flanges (just below the well head), resulting\\nin 0% LEL. After successfully cutting through the 42 inch drive pipe and the 20 inch\\ncasing, the welder began cutting the slot on the 13 3/8 inch casing. At\\napproximately 8:25 pm, a Tetra Offshore welder cut through the 13 3/8 inch casing at\\nthe plus ten deck with an Oxylance burning bar, igniting flammable gas trapped inside\\nthe 13 3/8 inch x 9 5/8 inch casing annulus. Operator statements report personnel\\nunsuccessfully attempted to extinguish the fire with a small water hose, and decided\\nto radio all personnel to evacuate the platform to the supporting derrick barge\\n(Tetra Hedron). According to personnel evacuating the platform, the flash fire\\nburned for an estimated 30 seconds and then extinguished itself. Fieldwood Energy\\nreported no injuries, pollution, or property damage.\\nAfter mustering the crew, the onsite supervisor assessed the situation and began\\nmitigation. The B-1 well casing valves were again tested for the presence of a\\ncombustible gas at the wellhead. The slot cut on the plus ten deck where the flash\\nfire occurred was also tested, but the small penetration of the 13 3/8 inch casing\\ndid not allow the gas detector to sense inside of the annulus. A 3/8 inch pilot hole\\nwas drilled at the plus ten deck through the 13 3/8 inch, 9 5/8 inch, and 7 3/4 inch\\nwall casings, and a combustible gas test was conducted. After drilling the pilot\\nhole, the measured LEL was too high for the gas detector to properly read.\\nCompressed air was supplied to 7 3/4 inch casing and circulated through the 9 5/8\\ninch and 13 3/8 inch casings, and then vented through the 3/8 inch pilot hole.\\nAnother combustible gas test was conducted, and the LEL ranged between 5% LEL to 16%\\nLEL in 20 minutes. The 3/8 inch pilot hole was then sealed, and compressed air was\\nsupplied into the 13 3/8 casing flange and circulated through the 13 3/8 inch x 9 5/8\\ninch annulus. A final combustible gas test was conducted and found to have 0% LEL.\\nAt 3:05 am, the site was deemed safe, an Ultimate Work Authority document to resume\\noperations (provided to BSEE investigators) was completed, and operations continued. \\n\\n   \n",

This eWell will be updated after the investigation is complete.\\n\\n**Update - January 18, 2018**\\nOur office was closed due to the weather conditions on January 17, 2017 so we were not able to submit an eWell update on the follow-up due date. The investigation is still ongoing so there is nothing to report at this time. \\n\\n**Update - February 9, 2018**\\nThe findings of the investigation are as follows:\\n\\nIMMEDIATE CAUSES: \\n  * A problematic Kenco Oil Regulator / Level Safety Low (LSL) malfunctioned, exacerbated by increased oil viscosity due to excessively cold temperatures.  In response to the low level alarm, operations manually added oil to the running engine to clear the alarm, exceeding the OEM maximum recommended level.  Residual oil migrated thru the engine, breached the exhaust system and ignited.\\n\\nSYSTEMIC CAUSES:\\n  * Communication\\n     ** Lack of recognizing and reporting chronic issues to maintenance organization.\\n  * Training / Knowledge transfer\\n     ** Knowledge transfer not effective\\n        *** Hazard Identification - Overfill\\n        *** Crankcase Oil Level Checking\\n\\nACTIONS-\\n * Issue a memorandum to communicate the \"Consequences of Overfilling Oil Levels and proper way of checking crankcase oil levels.\" 1Q2018- Maintenance Superintendent\\n  * Review with operations during annual safety meeting  2Q2018- Maintenance Superintendent\\n\\nAREA OF IMPROVEMENT-\\n  * Verify current operations / maintenance are in line with OEM / Industry accepted practice. 1Q2018 - Maintenance Superintendent\\n  * Mount Kenco Oil Regulator/ Sensor directly to the engine.  This will ensure a directly level measurement and increased temperature. 1Q2018- Production Operations\\n\\n**UPDATED April 17, 2018**\\nIn response to the BSEE's comments about changing the incident root cause:\\nWe initially thought the root cause of the incident was due to the missing o-ring and higher than normal oil viscosity due to unusually low temperature. The investigation team took a deeper dive by contacting the engine manufacture and further investigation determined that the missing o-ring and high oil viscosity was only a contributing factor to the incident and in fact the root cause was determined to be overfilling the engine sump with oil. The reason why this changed the root cause was because if the engine had not been overfilled, the oil would not have carried over through the crank case breather and into the engine's air intake system resulting in a fire.\\n\\n  * A Safety Bulletin and Maintenance Memorandum was sent to field personnel notifying everyone of the investigation findings, root cause and addressed corrective actions.\\n\\nPlease accept this report as the final report.</td>\n",

Platform operators were correcting the high level when they noticed excessive smoke from generator building vent fans. The operators opened the door to the generator building and observed small flames on the generator exhaust manifold.  One operator activated the ESD for the platform and grabbed a hand-held extinguisher and applied it to the manifold. The second operator sounded the general alarm and shut down the generator before grabbing another extinguisher.  Upon investigation, it was learned that the dump valve failed to open, causing a fluid carryover.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Final - While landing the final BOP test joint onto (3) riser joints in the riser bay, a 4x4 being used as cribbing broke causing the test joint and other test joints that had been previously landed to fall between two riser joints positioned on deck. The combined weight shock loaded the single leg sling that was still attached to the crane block and the test joint causing the sling to part. The test joints came to rest on the deck after falling approximately 3' in-between the riser joints. No personnel were in the area, and the void between riser joints was inaccessible to personnel and not a space able to be occupied due to the arrangement. The job was stopped and rig management was notified. All rigging involved was removed from service. \\n\\nShell considers this incident to fall in a \"gray area\" of the incident reporting regulations for the following reasons:\\n.\\tThe load, the final BOP test joint, was landed, thus it is no longer a load and a material handling incident.  \\n.\\tThe sling did not fail. \\n.\\tWhen the 4x4 that the load was landed on broke, the final BOP test joint began to fall, and the weight of the load plus the momentum shock loaded the sling. \\n.\\tIt is our understanding that shock loading is not reportable unless the resulting damage exceeds $25,000.\\n\\nFrom NTL 2008-G17:\\nCrane or personnel/material handling incident (as used in 30 CFR 250.188(a)(8)) means an incident involving a failure of the crane itself (e.g., the boom, cables, winches, ballring), other lifting apparatus (e.g., air tuggesr, chain pulls), the rigging hardware (e.g., slings, shackles, turnbuckles), or the load (e.g., striking personnel, dropping the load, damaging the load, damaging the facility).</td>\n",

       "0  There was a fire on the gas compressor that developed between the exhaust system and insulation blanket. The investigation is underway to determine the root cause. This eWell will be updated after the investigation is complete.\\n\\n**Update - January 18, 2018**\\nOur office was closed due to the weather conditions on January 17, 2017 so we were not able to submit an eWell update on the follow-up due date. The investigation is still ongoing so there is nothing to report at this time. \\n\\n**Update - February 9, 2018**\\nThe findings of the investigation are as follows:\\n\\nIMMEDIATE CAUSES: \\n  * A problematic Kenco Oil Regulator / Level Safety Low (LSL) malfunctioned, exacerbated by increased oil viscosity due to excessively cold temperatures.  In response to the low level alarm, operations manually added oil to the running engine to clear the alarm, exceeding the OEM maximum recommended level.  Residual oil migrated thru the engine, breached the exhaust system and ignited.\\n\\nSYSTEMIC CAUSES:\\n  * Communication\\n     ** Lack of recognizing and reporting chronic issues to maintenance organization.\\n  * Training / Knowledge transfer\\n     ** Knowledge transfer not effective\\n        *** Hazard Identification - Overfill\\n        *** Crankcase Oil Level Checking\\n\\nACTIONS-\\n * Issue a memorandum to communicate the \"Consequences of Overfilling Oil Levels and proper way of checking crankcase oil levels.\" 1Q2018- Maintenance Superintendent\\n  * Review with operations during annual safety meeting  2Q2018- Maintenance Superintendent\\n\\nAREA OF IMPROVEMENT-\\n  * Verify current operations / maintenance are in line with OEM / Industry accepted practice. 1Q2018 - Maintenance Superintendent\\n  * Mount Kenco Oil Regulator/ Sensor directly to the engine.  This will ensure a directly level measurement and increased temperature. 1Q2018- Production Operations\\n\\n**UPDATED April 17, 2018**\\nIn response to the BSEE's comments about changing the incident root cause:\\nWe initially thought the root cause of the incident was due to the missing o-ring and higher than normal oil viscosity due to unusually low temperature. The investigation team took a deeper dive by contacting the engine manufacture and further investigation determined that the missing o-ring and high oil viscosity was only a contributing factor to the incident and in fact the root cause was determined to be overfilling the engine sump with oil. The reason why this changed the root cause was because if the engine had not been overfilled, the oil would not have carried over through the crank case breather and into the engine's air intake system resulting in a fire.\\n\\n  * A Safety Bulletin and Maintenance Memorandum was sent to field personnel notifying everyone of the investigation findings, root cause and addressed corrective actions.\\n\\nPlease accept this report as the final report.   \n",

Platform operators were correcting the high level when they noticed excessive smoke from generator building vent fans. The operators opened the door to the generator building and observed small flames on the generator exhaust manifold.  One operator activated the ESD for the platform and grabbed a hand-held extinguisher and applied it to the manifold. The second operator sounded the general alarm and shut down the generator before grabbing another extinguisher.  Upon investigation, it was learned that the dump valve failed to open, causing a fluid carryover.   \n",

The IP was sent to shore via boat to see a physician and it was determined they had a broken elbow. They has been released to restricted work, and at this time there is no lost time anticipated.   \n",

The combined weight shock loaded the single leg sling that was still attached to the crane block and the test joint causing the sling to part. The test joints came to rest on the deck after falling approximately 3' in-between the riser joints. No personnel were in the area, and the void between riser joints was inaccessible to personnel and not a space able to be occupied due to the arrangement. The job was stopped and rig management was notified. All rigging involved was removed from service. \\n\\nShell considers this incident to fall in a \"gray area\" of the incident reporting regulations for the following reasons:\\n.\\tThe load, the final BOP test joint, was landed, thus it is no longer a load and a material handling incident.  \\n.\\tThe sling did not fail. \\n.\\tWhen the 4x4 that the load was landed on broke, the final BOP test joint began to fall, and the weight of the load plus the momentum shock loaded the sling. \\n.\\tIt is our understanding that shock loading is not reportable unless the resulting damage exceeds $25,000.\\n\\nFrom NTL 2008-G17:\\nCrane or personnel/material handling incident (as used in 30 CFR 250.188(a)(8)) means an incident involving a failure of the crane itself (e.g., the boom, cables, winches, ballring), other lifting apparatus (e.g., air tuggesr, chain pulls), the rigging hardware (e.g., slings, shackles, turnbuckles), or the load (e.g., striking personnel, dropping the load, damaging the load, damaging the facility).   \n",

Shutdown emergency generator and turbines. Stand by vessels informed of situation and instructed to move to safe location. Production crews blew down facility and isolated equipment responsible, and leak stopped/secured.\\n\\nCorrective actions taken: Replaced damaged hose. Investigative actions initiated. Initiated inspection of hoses of similar type and construction on facility.\\nReplacement hoses ordered with stamping for date of manufacture and applicable pressure ratings. Recommended development and implementation of inspection/ replacement program for all similar hoses in production system, subsequent to investigative outcome and related recommendations.\\n\\nUntil further notice, flexible hoses in the Gas Dehydration System being purchased or replaced with existing spares must be coordinated through the Tech Services Group. Also, if work is being done on equipment with flexible hose(s) in the above service, it is highly recommended that a new replacement be purchased prior to work being conducted.</td>\n",

The short caused a temporary drop in UPS voltage, which caused the loss of power to the DTS Control Panel and the Control Room 120v. The loss of power to the control room servers caused a complete shut in of the field. There was no muster of personnel or loss of dynamic positioning.\\n\\nInitial Actions:\\n* Operators smelt burning smell and immediately began investigating.\\n* Arc shut down 120 volt UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) to the control system.\\n* Killed power to the DTS (Disconnected Transfer System) and Control Room 120v which sent a false alarm to disconnect buoy and a complete shut in of the field. Operations verified that it was a false alarm.\\n* Replaced surge protector with a new surge protector.\\n\\nInvestigative Findings:\\nEmployees had recently stripped old wax off the deck when moisture inadvertently wicked into the surge protector.\\n\\nCausal Factors: \\n* The surge protector failed due to water/moisture contacting surge protector.\\n* The surge protector was located on deck.\\n\\nRoot Cause: \\n* Human Engineering\\n   -Human/Machine Interface\\n      -Arrangement/Placement of equipment\\n*Equipment Difficulty\\n   -Storage\\n\\nCorrective Actions:\\n1.

Immediately after that a loud continuous noise could be heard throughout the platform. It was determined that there was a gas leak from the suction hose of the glycol recycle pump hose.\\n\\nImmediate Actions: Platform ESD activated. All personnel mustered. Shutdown emergency generator and turbines. Stand by vessels informed of situation and instructed to move to safe location. Production crews blew down facility and isolated equipment responsible, and leak stopped/secured.\\n\\nCorrective actions taken: Replaced damaged hose. Investigative actions initiated. Initiated inspection of hoses of similar type and construction on facility.\\nReplacement hoses ordered with stamping for date of manufacture and applicable pressure ratings. Recommended development and implementation of inspection/ replacement program for all similar hoses in production system, subsequent to investigative outcome and related recommendations.\\n\\nUntil further notice, flexible hoses in the Gas Dehydration System being purchased or replaced with existing spares must be coordinated through the Tech Services Group. Also, if work is being done on equipment with flexible hose(s) in the above service, it is highly recommended that a new replacement be purchased prior to work being conducted.   \n",

       "2  A surge protector that was used to power several of the monitors in the Control Room shorted out. Personnel smelled a burn odor but did not see smoke or fire. The short caused a temporary drop in UPS voltage, which caused the loss of power to the DTS Control Panel and the Control Room 120v. The loss of power to the control room servers caused a complete shut in of the field. There was no muster of personnel or loss of dynamic positioning.\\n\\nInitial Actions:\\n* Operators smelt burning smell and immediately began investigating.\\n* Arc shut down 120 volt UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) to the control system.\\n* Killed power to the DTS (Disconnected Transfer System) and Control Room 120v which sent a false alarm to disconnect buoy and a complete shut in of the field. Operations verified that it was a false alarm.\\n* Replaced surge protector with a new surge protector.\\n\\nInvestigative Findings:\\nEmployees had recently stripped old wax off the deck when moisture inadvertently wicked into the surge protector.\\n\\nCausal Factors: \\n* The surge protector failed due to water/moisture contacting surge protector.\\n* The surge protector was located on deck.\\n\\nRoot Cause: \\n* Human Engineering\\n   -Human/Machine Interface\\n      -Arrangement/Placement of equipment\\n*Equipment Difficulty\\n   -Storage\\n\\nCorrective Actions:\\n1. Root Cause - Human Engineering - Arrangement/Placement of equipment\\n* Corrective Action - Replaced power strip, relocated off the floor, and\\nsecured to the desk.\\n\\n2. Root Cause - Human Engineering - Arrangement/Placement of equipment\\n* Corrective action - Talos production performed walkthrough of the production deck 5 and 7 to ensure all power strip and/or surge protectors were secured off the ground.\\n\\n3.

When picking up the water blaster, it made contact with the Aqueos control house knocking off a sheet metal window guard. No injuries or damage to other equipment.\\n\\nImmediate Corrective Actions:\\nCrane Operator spoke to Captain of the M/V to ensure no other damage or injuries; this was confirmed. Window guard is field repairable. \\n\\nInvestigation Results:\\nDid not adequately discuss lift order and lift proximity to each other.\\n\\nRecurrence Prevention Corrective Actions:\\nWhen planning lifts, need to ensure better communication between crane operator and deck hand as to how close loads are next to one another when\\ntransferring equipment.   \n",

       "      <td>While performing an intelatrac round, EE discovered a small amount of process gas leaking from the DOT VPSV. EE immediately contacted the CRO and OIM, and a controlled platform shutdown was initiated. Further evaluation of the VPSV by ACRs and engineering determined that it had a compromised seal. A repair was performed, and replacement parts put on order. Platform start-up was authorized after engineering evaluations completed and field mitigations were put in place. The total amount of gas leaked during this event was calculated at approximately 0-10kg.  No work was being performed on the DOT VPSV, the leak was detected during a regular round of the platform.  The facility was at full production rate.  No pollution was associated with the leak; no fluids/liquids entered the Gulf of Mexico.  There was no muster performed.  There was no hot work being performed at the time the leak was detected.  The estimated cost to repair the leaking seal was $300.00.  Corrective Action:  Compromised seal was replaced, further investigation is currently underway to determine failure cause._x000D_\\nUpdated January 20, 2022:  Concerning the investigation of the DOT VPSV seal failure; the VPSV was replaced during a Pit Stop or TAR with an under rated VPSV.  The ordered VPSV went off of the original spec and the team wasn't aware of a previous MOC.  The VPSV is scheduled to be replaced in the 2022 TAR.  Until the 2022 TAR, rebuild kits are onboard if it should leak again._x000D_\\nJanuary 27, 2022 Update:  A pit stop is a short amount of time for a shut-in to execute work, whereas a TAR (turnaround) is a longer period of time.</td>\n",

       "1  While performing an intelatrac round, EE discovered a small amount of process gas leaking from the DOT VPSV. EE immediately contacted the CRO and OIM, and a controlled platform shutdown was initiated. Further evaluation of the VPSV by ACRs and engineering determined that it had a compromised seal. A repair was performed, and replacement parts put on order. Platform start-up was authorized after engineering evaluations completed and field mitigations were put in place. The total amount of gas leaked during this event was calculated at approximately 0-10kg.  No work was being performed on the DOT VPSV, the leak was detected during a regular round of the platform.  The facility was at full production rate.  No pollution was associated with the leak; no fluids/liquids entered the Gulf of Mexico.  There was no muster performed.  There was no hot work being performed at the time the leak was detected.  The estimated cost to repair the leaking seal was $300.00.  Corrective Action:  Compromised seal was replaced, further investigation is currently underway to determine failure cause._x000D_\\nUpdated January 20, 2022:  Concerning the investigation of the DOT VPSV seal failure; the VPSV was replaced during a Pit Stop or TAR with an under rated VPSV.  The ordered VPSV went off of the original spec and the team wasn't aware of a previous MOC.  The VPSV is scheduled to be replaced in the 2022 TAR.  Until the 2022 TAR, rebuild kits are onboard if it should leak again._x000D_\\nJanuary 27, 2022 Update:  A pit stop is a short amount of time for a shut-in to execute work, whereas a TAR (turnaround) is a longer period of time.     \n",

The unit was manually shut down immediately and the flame was extinguished using a 30# ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher. A collective investigation was conducted, and it was determined that a small gas leak from the oil separator was ignited by a hot surface and/or ignition wire. The deficient oil separator was removed and replaced; there was no other damage to the component due to direct flame impingement. No injuries, property damage, or pollution occurred.\\n   \n",
